# Tranzit-EE-Lightning-Always-at-Cornfield
This mod consists of a small modification to the Avogadro AI script that causes the lightning which spawns the Avogadro to always remain over the cornfield. Place the file in the ".\AppData\Local\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm" folder (NOT ".\AppData\Local\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\zm_tranzit")

This mod does not change any easter egg steps, or other Avogadro behaviour. It is meant to be used in conjunction with Tranzit-Maxis-EE-Solo-Tweak () as a quality of life change while completing the Maxis EE. The Avogadro will still take the standard 2-5 rounds to spawn, but since the lightning will always remain over the cornfield the player will not have to wait 5-10 minutes for the lightning to appear overhead before ending each round.

Compiled with gsc-tool: https://github.com/xensik/gsc-tool#gsc-tool using the command "gsc-tool comp t6 Tranzit-EE-Lightning-Always-at-Cornfield.gsc"
